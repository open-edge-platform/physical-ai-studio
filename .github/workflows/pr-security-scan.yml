# Pull Request Security scan workflow for the Geti project

# This workflow is triggered on pull requests to main and release branches.
# It performs focused security scanning on changed files using multiple tools to identify
# vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and code quality problems in the modified code.
# The workflow provides fast feedback during the review process with stricter validation.

# Key Features:
# - Scans only changed files for faster execution
# - Uses MEDIUM severity levels for balanced security coverage
# - Fails on findings to ensure security standards before merging

# Process Stages:
# 1. Scan GitHub Actions workflows for security issues (Zizmor)
# 2. Analyze Python code security in changed files (Bandit)
# 3. Run semantic security analysis on modifications (Semgrep)

# Security Tools:
# - Zizmor: GitHub Actions workflow security scanner
# - Bandit: Python security linter
# - Semgrep: Static analysis tool for finding bugs and security issues
