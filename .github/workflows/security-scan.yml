# Security scan workflow for the Geti project

# This workflow is triggered on schedule, workflow_dispatch, and pushes to develop and release branches.
# It performs comprehensive security scanning using multiple tools to identify vulnerabilities,
# secrets, configuration issues, and code quality problems across the entire codebase.
# It also scans GitHub Actions workflows for potential security issues.

# Key Features:
# - Scans GitHub Actions workflows for security vulnerabilities (Zizmor)
# - Performs static security analysis of Python code (Bandit)
# - Scans for vulnerabilities, secrets, and misconfigurations (Trivy)
# - Conducts semantic code analysis for security issues (Semgrep)

# Process Stages:
# 1. Scan GitHub Actions workflows with Zizmor
# 2. Analyze Python code security with Bandit
# 3. Perform filesystem security scan with Trivy
# 4. Run semantic security analysis with Semgrep

# Security Tools:
# - Zizmor: GitHub Actions workflow security scanner
# - Bandit: Python security linter
# - Trivy: Vulnerability and misconfiguration scanner
# - Semgrep: Static analysis tool for finding bugs and security issues
