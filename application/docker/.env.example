# Container user UID/GID — override to match your host user so that
# bind-mounted volumes (e.g. calibration data) have correct ownership.
# Run `id -u` and `id -g` to find your host values.
# APP_UID=1000
# APP_GID=1000

# Host device-group GIDs — override when your host uses different GIDs
# than the Debian/Ubuntu defaults (e.g. Arch Linux). These are passed to
# Docker's group_add so the container process can access host devices.
# Run `application/docker/setup-devices.sh` to auto-detect these values.
#
# The defaults (dialout, plugdev, video) are group names that Docker
# resolves against the container's /etc/group. This works on Debian/Ubuntu
# hosts where the GIDs match. On other distros, set numeric GIDs here.
# VIDEO_GID=984
# DIALOUT_GID=985
