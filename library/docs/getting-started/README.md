## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Basic Python knowledge
- ~2GB disk space for demo datasets
- GPU recommended (CPU works but is slower)

## What You'll Build

By the end of these tutorials, you'll have:

1. ✅ A trained ACT policy on the ALOHA cube transfer task
2. ✅ Benchmark results showing your policy's performance
3. ✅ An exported model ready for deployment
